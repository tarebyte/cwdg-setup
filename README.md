##Description
This is a beginner web development envirorment for our new members of the [Collegiate Web Developers](http://cwdg.github.com) 
who use OSX as their primary operationg system.

##Technologies used

* Shell Script

##Getting Started
Please note that this is a for Mac OSX only!!!! If you try to run this on any other system you're going to have a bad time :-(

###Requirements

####Xcode
If you are running a machine with OSX, please install XCode through the App Store and Install the Command Line Tools.

####A Github Account
Please sign up for [Github](http://www.github.com), it's free and it's awesome

###Obtain the Project

Since this project is assuming you don't have Git make just download it as a zip.

###Installing

Open the directory of the project:

    cd cwdg-setup

Then run:

    ./setup

And that's it, the rest of the installation will take care of it and that's it, the rest of the installation will take care of itself!

##What this installs / sets up

####For OSX
- [HomeBrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
  * [Rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)
  * [Ruby-Build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)
  * [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Http Authentication for Github](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

##ToDo
- Add port for linux
